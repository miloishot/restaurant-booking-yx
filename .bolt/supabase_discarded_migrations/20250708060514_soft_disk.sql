  # Fix RLS policies for restaurant tables

  1. Security Updates
    - Drop existing restrictive policies that may be causing issues
    - Create comprehensive policies for restaurant table management
    - Ensure proper access for restaurant owners and staff
    - Allow public read access for booking purposes

  2. Policy Changes
    - Restaurant owners can manage all tables in their restaurants
    - Restaurant staff can manage tables in their assigned restaurant
    - Public users can read tables for restaurants with public slugs
    - Authenticated users can perform all operations on tables they have access to
